Apache/AuthCookieNTLM version 0.06
==================================

As explained in the Apache::AuthenNTLM module, depending on the user's 
config, IE will supply your Windows logon credentials to the web server
when the server asks for NTLM authentication. This saves the user typing in
their windows login and password. 

Apache::AuthCookieNTLM is an interface to Shannon Peevey's 
Apache::AuthenNTLM module. The main aim is to authenticate a user 
using their Windows login and authenticating against the Windows
PDC, but to also store their login name into a cookie. This means
that it can be accessed from other pages and stops the system
having to authenticate for every request.
